<p>The project currently has three main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, Iâ€™m considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of there parts: a door with hinges and the house which i divided into bottom and top. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.
