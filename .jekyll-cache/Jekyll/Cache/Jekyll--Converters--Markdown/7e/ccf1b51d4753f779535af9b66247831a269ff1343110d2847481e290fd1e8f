<p>As previously outlined in earlier project updates, Iâ€™m in the process of developing a laser gun game. This project encompasses 3D printed components, as well as electronics featuring the Arduino Uno R4 equipped with an ESP32 chip for wireless functionality. In this update, weâ€™ll delve into the gameâ€™s design, development, and installation processes to achieve a functional prototype.</p>
