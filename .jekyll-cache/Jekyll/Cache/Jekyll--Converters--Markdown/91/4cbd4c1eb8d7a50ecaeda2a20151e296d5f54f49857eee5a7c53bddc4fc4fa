<p>In my previous post, I already outlined the concept for my final project. While choosing the right project for this subject, I had to weigh several factors, including the learning objectives set by the course and how best to present my work to my professor. I began by reviewing the core components of the subject, which encompassed electronics, CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting, and web-app development. This led to extensive brainstorming on potential projects. Although I have a passion for prototyping and product development, I was cautious not to overextend the project‚Äôs scope.</p>

<p>It was essential for my project to incorporate electronics, and I wanted parts that could move without overly complicating the design. This led me to choose servo motors. I then needed to select a central processing unit for the project, and I opted for the Arduino Uno. My choice was influenced by its foundation on the ATMega328P chip, which I am familiar with from my bachelor‚Äôs studies in electronics. Additionally, I have extensive experience using the Arduino Uno in past hobby projects.</p>

<p>For movement, I decided to integrate four servo motors. These motors will control the appearance and disappearance of targets in my shooting game, adhering to a ‚Äúkeep-it-simple‚Äù philosophy. To detect hits on the targets, I plan to use a light sensor that can measure resistance levels when a light beam is detected.</p>

<p>The initial design was too basic, and I realized that to secure a higher grade for this subject, I needed to enhance its complexity. Consequently, I‚Äôve decided to use an ESP32 to create a web-app accessible via smartphones. This web-app will offer users the option to increase the challenge by adjusting the speed of the targets or altering the pattern in which targets become visible. By integrating the web-app, I can genuinely encompass all the primary learning objectives of the subject.</p>

<p>My project involves creating a shooting game where shots are simulated with a laser gun. I‚Äôm not focusing much on the gun itself; instead, I‚Äôm directing my attention to the target that needs to be hit. This is where the electronics and movement of the target objects will be incorporated. I made this decision based on the time constraints.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought of constructing a large apartment block with four doors that could open. However, due to what I assume are limitations in 3D printer size, I‚Äôm now considering four identical houses placed at some distance from each other. I believe this will enhance the gaming experience as the objects can be positioned at varying distances from one another. Additionally, having identical house objects simplifies the CAD process. One of the houses will serve as the main unit, housing all the electronics. For now, the houses will be interconnected using cable connections.‚Äù</p>

<p>The project currently has two main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, I‚Äôm considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of two parts: a door with hinges and the house itself. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.</p>

<p>The targets will likely be 3D models that I‚Äôll source from the internet. After downloading these 3D assets, I‚Äôll proceed directly to 3D printing.</p>
