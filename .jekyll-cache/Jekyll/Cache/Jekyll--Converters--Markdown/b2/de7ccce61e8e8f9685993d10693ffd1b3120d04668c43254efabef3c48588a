<p>In my previous post Iâ€™ve allready posted what I want to build as my Final Project. In my process of selecting the right project for this subject, I had to consider several factors as what the subject requires for me to learn and master and how I can view that to my professor. First of all I had to go over all the main components in the subject and found out it included Electronics, CAD, 3D printing, Laser cutting and Web-App. So I had a lot of brainstorming of what I can do, but I didnt wanted to go overboard with project (which I easily can do since I have love for prototyping and product development). So I had to select a project that included electronics, and parts had to have some kind of movement and didnt want to over complicate the project so I wanted to use servo-motors. First of all I had to select the one brain, and for that I decided to use an Arduino Uno. Reason for that is that its built on a ATMega328P chip which im familliar with from my bachelor studies in Electronics. Ive also have a lot of experience from using Arduino Uno in my previous hobby projects. For the movement I wanted to include 4 servo motors. The servo motors gives the movement of viewing and hiding the targets in my shooting game and its important to follow the keep-it-simple mindset. To detect the any hits on objects Im planning to use light sensor which can monitor resistance level when a light beam has been detected.</p>
