<p>The project currently has three main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, I‚Äôm considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of there parts: a door with hinges and the house which i divided into bottom and top. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.

<h2 id="11-house-bottom">1.1 House (Bottom)</h2>
<p>This is the base of the house. I searched the internet for inspiration, looking for something simple. Initially, I considered a large house or wall that could interlock with others, but I realized it was unnecessary. Additionally, I wanted the ability to adjust the distance between my ‚Äútargets‚Äù to make it challenging for users to aim quickly. The house has an opening for a door, and the roof is separate.

<h2 id="12-house-top">1.2 House (Top)</h2>
<p>This is the top of the house, which functions like a hat. This design makes it easy to lift off, allowing for convenient access to work on the contents, such as attaching the servo, toy figure, and sensor.

<h2 id="13-door">1.3 Door</h2>
<p>This is the movable part of the project. The door is held in place by a pin that goes through the ‚Äúhinges‚Äù mounted on the house‚Äôs wall. The door is designed to open inward.
