<p>In my previous post, I already outlined the concept for my final project. While choosing the right project for this subject, I had to weigh several factors, including the learning objectives set by the course and how best to present my work to my professor. I began by reviewing the core components of the subject, which encompassed electronics, CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting, and web-app development. This led to extensive brainstorming on potential projects. Although I have a passion for prototyping and product development, I was cautious not to overextend the project‚Äôs scope.</p>

<p>It was essential for my project to incorporate electronics, and I wanted parts that could move without overly complicating the design. This led me to choose servo motors. I then needed to select a central processing unit for the project, and I opted for the Arduino Uno. My choice was influenced by its foundation on the ATMega328P chip, which I am familiar with from my bachelor‚Äôs studies in electronics. Additionally, I have extensive experience using the Arduino Uno in past hobby projects.</p>

<p>For movement, I decided to integrate four servo motors. These motors will control the appearance and disappearance of targets in my shooting game, adhering to a ‚Äúkeep-it-simple‚Äù philosophy. To detect hits on the targets, I plan to use a light sensor that can measure resistance levels when a light beam is detected.</p>

<p>I believe using this servo motor creates enough movement for my project

<p>The initial design was too basic, and I realized that to secure a higher grade for this subject, I needed to enhance its complexity. Consequently, I‚Äôve decided to use an ESP32 to create a web-app accessible via smartphones. This web-app will offer users the option to increase the challenge by adjusting the speed of the targets or altering the pattern in which targets become visible. By integrating the web-app, I can genuinely encompass all the primary learning objectives of the subject.</p>

<h1 id="2-cad---the-visual-aspects">2 CAD - The Visual aspects</h1>
<p>My project involves creating a shooting game where shots are simulated with a laser gun. I‚Äôm not focusing much on the gun itself; instead, I‚Äôm directing my attention to the target that needs to be hit. This is where the electronics and movement of the target objects will be incorporated. I made this decision based on the time constraints.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought of constructing a large apartment block with four doors that could open. However, due to what I assume are limitations in 3D printer size, I‚Äôm now considering four identical houses placed at some distance from each other. I believe this will enhance the gaming experience as the objects can be positioned at varying distances from one another. Additionally, having identical house objects simplifies the CAD process. One of the houses will serve as the main unit, housing all the electronics. For now, the houses will be interconnected using cable connections.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="21-main-parts">2.1 Main parts</h2>

<p>The project currently has two main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, I‚Äôm considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of there parts: a door with hinges and the house which i divided into bottom and top. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.1 House Bottom</strong></p>

<p>This is the base of the house. I searched the internet for inspiration, looking for something simple. Initially, I considered a large house or wall that could interlock with others, but I realized it was unnecessary. Additionally, I wanted the ability to adjust the distance between my ‚Äútargets‚Äù to make it challenging for users to aim quickly. The house has an opening for a door, and the roof is separate.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.2 House Top</strong></p>

<p>This is the top of the house, which functions like a hat. This design makes it easy to lift off, allowing for convenient access to work on the contents, such as attaching the servo, toy figure, and sensor.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.3 Door</strong></p>

<p>This is the movable part of the project. The door is held in place by a pin that goes through the ‚Äúhinges‚Äù mounted on the house‚Äôs wall. The door is designed to open inward.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.4 Targets</strong></p>

<p>The targets will likely be 3D models that I‚Äôll source from the internet. After downloading these 3D assets, I‚Äôll proceed directly to 3D printing.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.5 Electronic Enclosure</strong></p>

<h2 id="22-manufacturing-process">2.2 Manufacturing Process</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm planning for all components of this project to be 3D printed. At first, I considered laser-cutting the box for the electronics. However, I now believe that if I can 3D print it and attach it to the house, the overall product will look better. The house‚Äôs dimensions must be within the capabilities of the 3D printer, both in terms of width and height.</p>

<h2 id="23-external-components">2.3 External Components</h2>
<p>For external components, I‚Äôm considering using screws, glue to attach figures to the house, and electronics. Additionally, there will be accessories for the servo motor to facilitate movements, such as opening and closing the door. These are the primary elements I envision needing for the project. In my opinion, it‚Äôs too early to specify all the equipment required. Everything must be produced first to determine what I‚Äôll need to complete the device.</p>
