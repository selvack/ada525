### Initiation / Web install
I have now created my site as requested by the subject. The page is now up and running on a custom webserver, but source files is pushed to GitHub. [http://github.com/selvack/ada525/](http://github.com/selvack/ada525/)

To setup my development environment on my Mac I used these commands 
``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # installerer homebrew
brew install chruby ruby-install xz # installerer chruby, ruby-install xz
ruby-install ruby # installerer ruby
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc # run 'chruby' to see actual version 
``` 
Restart the terminal
``` bash
ruby -v # versjon 3.2 something
gem install jekyll
```


For this project I chose to use a jekyll template called [Klise](http://github.com/selvack/ada525/) which can be found on their theme catalog. To use the theme
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Now the webserver should be running locally on [127.0.0.1:4000](127.0.0.1:4000) or [localhost:4000](localhost:4000)

Then i opened the folder in Visual Studio Code and edited the necessery files and from the console.
Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as editing language for text-html compiler.

``` bash
git init # initerer  
git add . # legger til alle filene i folderen til opplasting 
git commit -m "intial commit" # forplikter seg til Ã¥ sende filer over med beskrivelsen "intial commit"
git remote add orgin https://github.com/selvack/ada525.git # lager en kobling "remote" med link til github-repo
git push orgin main # pusher filene til github-repo
```


My Final project outline
========================
For my final project i plan to build a laser gun game. The idea is to shoot laser towards some targets as play infantry soldiers and with a hit the score will be visable on a display. This project will most likely rely on using an Arduino circuit.

Undecided factors per now
-------------------------
There are several factors that are undecided pr now and will be determined as the subject will progress. Here is a quick list of that
* Targets (toy soldiers or an image) - These targes must have some kind of movements; maybe a step motor to have them fall if taken a hit?
* Display - LCDdisplay or a Segment display for counting points
* Sound - Support of any sound?
* CAD model for 3D gun - Not rendered any type of gun yet. Simplicity might be the fastest way of going with this (modding an exisiting gun)
