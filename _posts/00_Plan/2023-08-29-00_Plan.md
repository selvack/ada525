## Project Initiation & Web Setup

I've successfully set up my website as specified by the project requirements. The live site is hosted on a custom webserver, and all source files are available on [GitHub](http://github.com/selvack/ada525/).

### Setting Up the Development Environment on Mac
Follow the steps below:

1. Install Homebrew:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    brew install chruby ruby-install xz
    ruby-install ruby
    ```

3. Configure chruby in ~/.zshrc:
    ```bash
    echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc  # Replace with the current version after running 'chruby'.
    ```

4. Restart the terminal, then:
    ```bash
    ruby -v  # To confirm the version.
    gem install jekyll
    ```

Project Theme & Setup
---------------------
1.  I used the [Klise](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise), a jekyll template for this project. To set it up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

2. Access the local server via [127.0.0.1:4000](127.0.0.1:4000) or [localhost:4000](localhost:4000).

3. Edit the necessary files using **Visual Studio Code**. Note: Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/jekyll/) for text-to-HTML conversion.


Deploying to GitHub
-------------------
Use these commands to push your local content to GitHub:
``` bash
git init
git add . 
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/selvack/ada525.git
git push origin main
```

My Final project outline
========================
For my final project, I intend to develop a laser gun game. The concept involves shooting lasers at target figures, designed to resemble infantry soldiers. Every successful hit will register and display a score on an integrated screen. The core of this project will likely be built around an Arduino circuit.

## Final Project: Undecided Factors

As we continue to develop our project, several components remain undecided. Here's a rundown of these aspects:

- **Targets (Toy soldiers or Images)**
  - The targets might have a movement mechanism.
  - *Thought:* Could a stepper motor be utilized to topple them when hit?

- **Display**
  - Choice between an LCD display or a Segment display for point tallying.

- **Sound**
  - Do we want to include sound effects?

- **CAD Model for the Laser Gun**
  - No design has been finalized for the gun.
  - *Strategy:* Perhaps modifying an existing gun design would expedite the process?

- **CAD Model for Infantry Barricades**
  - Is there a need for house-like barricades?
  - *Idea:* Could we "animate" a door that opens, presenting soldiers to the shooter?

- **Variety in Soldier Types**
  - Should one soldier have a unique rank, serving as a 'Boss' character?
  - *Advantage:* Hitting this character could yield more points.

- **2x Arduino in Serial Mode?**
  - The Arduino Uno has only 5 IO analog pins. Given that we're using 4 light-sensitive diodes and need an additional one for serial output to the display, this might pose a challenge.
  - To incorporate sound effects, we may need to use two Arduino Unos in tandem. Alternatively, I might find a simpler solution that requires just one Arduino.
