## Project Initiation & Web Setup

I've successfully set up my website as specified by the project requirements. The live site is hosted on a custom webserver, and all source files are available on [GitHub](http://github.com/selvack/ada525/).

### Setting Up the Development Environment on Mac
Follow the steps below:

1. Install Homebrew:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    brew install chruby ruby-install xz
    ruby-install ruby
    ```

3. Configure chruby in ~/.zshrc:
    ```bash
    echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc  # Replace with the current version after running 'chruby'.
    ```

4. Restart the terminal, then:
    ```bash
    ruby -v  # To confirm the version.
    gem install jekyll
    ```

Project Theme & Setup
---------------------
1.  I used the [Klise](http://github.com/selvack/ada525/), a jekyll template for this project. To set it up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

2. Access the local server via [127.0.0.1:4000](127.0.0.1:4000) or [localhost:4000](localhost:4000).

3. Edit the necessary files using **Visual Studio Code**. Note: Jekyll uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for text-to-HTML conversion.


Deploying to GitHub
-------------------
Use these commands to push your local content to GitHub:
``` bash
git init
git add . 
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/selvack/ada525.git
git push origin main
```

My Final project outline
========================
For my final project, I intend to develop a laser gun game. The concept involves shooting lasers at target figures, designed to resemble infantry soldiers. Every successful hit will register and display a score on an integrated screen. The core of this project will likely be built around an Arduino circuit.

Undecided factors per now
-------------------------
## Final Project: Laser Gun Game Considerations

Several aspects of the project remain undecided as of now. These factors will be determined as the project progresses. Below is a summary of these considerations:

- **Targets (Toy soldiers or images)** 
  - The targets should ideally have some mobility. Perhaps a stepper motor could be used to knock them down upon a successful hit?

- **Laser** 
  - What kind of Laser? A regular standalone laserpointer or PCB-laser unit and develop a seperate userside kit?

- **Display** 
  - Should we use an LCD display or a segment display to tally the scores?

- **Sound** 
  - Is there a need to integrate sound effects or any audio feedback?

- **CAD Model for the 3D Gun** 
  - No specific gun design has been finalized. Opting for a simple design, such as modifying an existing gun model, might expedite the development process.
