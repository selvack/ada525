# 1 Idea & Conceptualizing
In my previous post, I already outlined the concept for my final project. While choosing the right project for this subject, I had to weigh several factors, including the learning objectives set by the course and how best to present my work to my professor. I began by reviewing the core components of the subject, which encompassed electronics, CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting, and web-app development. This led to extensive brainstorming on potential projects. Although I have a passion for prototyping and product development, I was cautious not to overextend the project's scope.

It was essential for my project to incorporate electronics, and I wanted parts that could move without overly complicating the design. This led me to choose servo motors. I then needed to select a central processing unit for the project, and I opted for the Arduino Uno. My choice was influenced by its foundation on the ATMega328P chip, which I am familiar with from my bachelor's studies in electronics. Additionally, I have extensive experience using the Arduino Uno in past hobby projects.

For movement, I decided to integrate four servo motors. These motors will control the appearance and disappearance of targets in my shooting game, adhering to a "keep-it-simple" philosophy. To detect hits on the targets, I plan to use a light sensor that can measure resistance levels when a light beam is detected.

The initial design was too basic, and I realized that to secure a higher grade for this subject, I needed to enhance its complexity. Consequently, I've decided to use an ESP32 to create a web-app accessible via smartphones. This web-app will offer users the option to increase the challenge by adjusting the speed of the targets or altering the pattern in which targets become visible. By integrating the web-app, I can genuinely encompass all the primary learning objectives of the subject.
