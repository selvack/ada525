Assignment:
Design and 3D print a design that combines multiple parts. Your design should be as fabricatable as possible, meaning you should fabricate as much of the parts as possible. It's ok to use external components such as fasteners, bearings, etc.

You can make a design that is part of your final project, however this is not required.

Document the process of your design, how you set up the slicer and how you print the object. Include pictures of the printed object and of the process. Here are some things you should keep in mind:

Clearly describe the thing you are trying to make.
Describe how you plan to make it.
Document your progress in CAD.
Document how you set up the slicer and explain the different parameters you set.
