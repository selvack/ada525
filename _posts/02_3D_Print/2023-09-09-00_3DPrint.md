# 1 The 3D Model
The project currently has three main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, I'm considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of there parts: a door with hinges and the house which i divided into bottom and top. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.

## 1.1 House (Bottom)
This is the base of the house. I searched the internet for inspiration, looking for something simple. Initially, I considered a large house or wall that could interlock with others, but I realized it was unnecessary. Additionally, I wanted the ability to adjust the distance between my "targets" to make it challenging for users to aim quickly. The house has an opening for a door, and the roof is separate.

## 1.2 House (Top)
This is the top of the house, which functions like a hat. This design makes it easy to lift off, allowing for convenient access to work on the contents, such as attaching the servo, toy figure, and sensor.

## 1.3 Door
This is the movable part of the project. The door is held in place by a pin that goes through the "hinges" mounted on the house's wall. The door is designed to open inward.

# 2 From CAD to 3D print
Before printing the parts, I needed to ensure that they fit together without any collisions, especially the connections between the door and the house.

Given that this was my inaugural print, I opted for a wall thickness of 5mm to assess the sturdiness of the 3D prints. Fusion360 software conveniently supports a 3D printing setup, making it relatively straightforward to prepare a print.

These are my settings to create STL-files for the 3D-printer.

## 2.1 3D Print
To create the 3D print, I used Ultimaker 3 with PLA filaments in Black and White color.

I used the Ulitmaker Cura as my slicer for this project with these settings

"Before beginning the printing process, I applied a glue pen to coat the printing plate. This step helps reduce the likelihood of the print adhering too firmly to the glass.

Below are some pictures of the progress.

# 3 Evaluation and lesson learned

I found this exercise both enjoyable and enlightening, presenting numerous learning opportunities. The 3D printing aspect was particularly novel for me, and it quickly piqued my interest. During the printing process, I discovered that removing supports can be challenging. My door, being quite thin, sustained some damage when I attempted to remove its supports.

I also recognized the need to reduce the thickness of my walls to save on materials and decrease printing time. After assembling the initial print and testing all the components, I realized the necessity of adding a floor to the house to secure the electronics. I also made some adjustments to the roof's measurements to conserve materials further.

Another observation was the difficulty in removing a 3D print when its bottom layer is solidly adhered to the printing plate, especially since the 3D model automatically settled in the slicer. For future prints, I plan to introduce a support layer at the bottom to facilitate easier removal.
