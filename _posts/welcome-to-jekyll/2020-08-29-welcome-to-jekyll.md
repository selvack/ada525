### Initiation
I have now created my site as requested by the subject. The page is now up and running on a custom webserver, but source files is pushed to GitHub. http://github.com/selvack/ada525/


My Final project outline
========================
For my final project i plan to build a laser gun game. The idea is to shoot laser towards some targets as play infantry soldiers and with a hit the score will be visable on a display. This project will most likely rely on using an Arduino circuit.

Undecided factors per now
-------------------------
There are several factors that are undecided pr now and will be determined as the subject will progress. Here is a quick list of that
* Targets (toy soldiers or an image) - These targes must have some kind of movements; maybe a step motor to have them fall if taken a hit?
* Display - LCDdisplay or a Segment display for counting points
* Sound - Support of any sound?
* CAD model for 3D gun - Not rendered any type of gun yet. Simplicity might be the fastest way of going with this (modding an exisiting gun)
