<p>In my previous post, I already outlined the concept for my final project. While choosing the right project for this subject, I had to weigh several factors, including the learning objectives set by the course and how best to present my work to my professor. I began by reviewing the core components of the subject, which encompassed electronics, CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting, and web-app development. This led to extensive brainstorming on potential projects. Although I have a passion for prototyping and product development, I was cautious not to overextend the project’s scope.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2WJz1GN/Skjermbilde-2023-08-28-111433.png" alt="Project Outline" title="Laser Gun Game" /></p>

<p>It was essential for my project to incorporate electronics, and I wanted parts that could move without overly complicating the design. This led me to choose servo motors. I then needed to select a central processing unit for the project, and I opted for the Arduino Uno. My choice was influenced by its foundation on the ATMega328P chip, which I am familiar with from my bachelor’s studies in electronics. Additionally, I have extensive experience using the Arduino Uno in past hobby projects.</p>

<p>[ PICTURE OF ARDUINO UNO ]</p>

<p>For movement, I decided to integrate four servo motors. These motors will control the appearance and disappearance of targets in my shooting game, adhering to a “keep-it-simple” philosophy. To detect hits on the targets, I plan to use a light sensor that can measure resistance levels when a light beam is detected.</p>

<p>[ SHOW A PICTURE OF SERVO MOTOR WITH MOVEMENTS ]</p>

<p>The initial design was too basic, and I realized that to secure a higher grade for this subject, I needed to enhance its complexity. Consequently, I’ve decided to use an ESP32 to create a web-app accessible via smartphones. This web-app will offer users the option to increase the challenge by adjusting the speed of the targets or altering the pattern in which targets become visible. By integrating the web-app, I can genuinely encompass all the primary learning objectives of the subject.</p>

<h1 id="2-cad---the-visual-aspects">2 CAD - The Visual aspects</h1>
<p>My project involves creating a shooting game where shots are simulated with a laser gun. I’m not focusing much on the gun itself; instead, I’m directing my attention to the target that needs to be hit. This is where the electronics and movement of the target objects will be incorporated. I made this decision based on the time constraints.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought of constructing a large apartment block with four doors that could open. However, due to what I assume are limitations in 3D printer size, I’m now considering four identical houses placed at some distance from each other. I believe this will enhance the gaming experience as the objects can be positioned at varying distances from one another. Additionally, having identical house objects simplifies the CAD process. One of the houses will serve as the main unit, housing all the electronics. For now, the houses will be interconnected using cable connections.”</p>

<h2 id="21-main-parts">2.1 Main parts</h2>
<p>The project currently has two main components that need to be both 3D designed and printed. For efficiency, I’m considering making all the houses identical. Each house will consist of two parts: a door with hinges and the house itself. The electronics will be housed in a shielded enclosure, which will also have two parts: a frame and a lid.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.2 Door</strong></p>

<p>[ PICTURE OF DOOR ]</p>

<p><strong>2.1.3 Targets</strong></p>

<p>The targets will likely be 3D models that I’ll source from the internet. After downloading these 3D assets, I’ll proceed directly to 3D printing.</p>

<h2 id="22-manufacturing-process">2.2 Manufacturing Process</h2>
<p>I’m planning for all components of this project to be 3D printed. At first, I considered laser-cutting the box for the electronics. However, I now believe that if I can 3D print it and attach it to the house, the overall product will look better. The house’s dimensions must be within the capabilities of the 3D printer, both in terms of width and height.</p>

<h2 id="23-external-components">2.3 External Components</h2>
<p>For external components, I’m considering using screws, glue to attach figures to the house, and electronics. Additionally, there will be accessories for the servo motor to facilitate movements, such as opening and closing the door. These are the primary elements I envision needing for the project. In my opinion, it’s too early to specify all the equipment required. Everything must be produced first to determine what I’ll need to complete the device.</p>

<p>Since my selected jekyll themes plugin (jekyll-postfiles) isn’t supported by github pages, the site will encounter problems such as broken path or post images won’t show up. I chose therefor to host on my private web-server. 
To do so, upload this path to the site web-folder</p>

<h1 id="my-final-project-outline">My Final project outline</h1>
<p>For my final project, I intend to develop a laser gun game. The concept involves shooting lasers at target figures, designed to resemble infantry soldiers. Every successful hit will register and display a score on an integrated screen. The core of this project will likely be built around an Arduino circuit.</p>

<h2 id="final-project-undecided-factors">Final Project: Undecided Factors</h2>
<p>As we continue to develop our project, several components remain undecided. Here’s a rundown of these aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Targets (Toy soldiers or Images)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The targets might have a movement mechanism.</li>
      <li><em>Thought:</em> Could a stepper motor be utilized to topple them when hit?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Display</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Choice between an LCD display or a Segment display for point tallying.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sound</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Do we want to include sound effects?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CAD Model for the Laser Gun</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>No design has been finalized for the gun.</li>
      <li><em>Strategy:</em> Perhaps modifying an existing gun design would expedite the process?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CAD Model for Infantry Barricades</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Is there a need for house-like barricades?</li>
      <li><em>Idea:</em> Could we “animate” a door that opens, presenting soldiers to the shooter?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Variety in Soldier Types</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Should one soldier have a unique rank, serving as a ‘Boss’ character?</li>
      <li><em>Advantage:</em> Hitting this character could yield more points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>2x Arduino in Serial Mode?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The Arduino Uno has only 6 IO analog pins. Given that we’re using 4 light-sensitive diodes and need an additional one for serial output to the display, this might pose a challenge. This limits the soldiers to be maximum 4 and 1 for LCD if im to incorporate sound effects.</li>
      <li>To incorporate sound effects, we may need to use two Arduino Unos in tandem. Alternatively, I might find a simpler solution that requires just one Arduino.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
